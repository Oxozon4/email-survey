#### --- In development ---

Application created by following guidance in **'Node with React: Fullstack Web Development'** course by Stephen Grinder.

Its main feature is the ability for logged users to pay for sending forms via email to targeted audience. Users data, their credits and forms answers are stored in MongoDB.
Users can also view in a dashboard view all active sent email forms and recipients answers to them.

**Improved with**:

- replacing JS with TS,
- adding unit tests,
- TBD.
